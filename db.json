allows people to communicate their ideas and feelings in a way that words cannot.\n\n*Visual art can be used to convey emotions, tell stories, and create a sense of community.\n\n*It can also be used to educate people about different cultures and history.\n\n*Art is a form of expression that should be available to everyone.\n\n#  How does bringing visual art to the people help to promote creativity and community engagement?\n\nThe role of art in society has been debated for centuries.
