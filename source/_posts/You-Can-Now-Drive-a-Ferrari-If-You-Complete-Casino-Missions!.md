In a recent announcement, [CasinoCoin](https://casinocoin.org/) has declared that it will now be sponsoring driving Ferraris for their most dedicated and high-volume players. In order to be eligible, individuals must complete a set of CasinoCoin-sponsored casino missions.

Upon completing these objectives, participants will be awarded with a driver’s license that is good for one free spin in a Ferrari of their choice! The only requirement is that drivers must maintain an active CasinoCoin account and meet the minimum monthly betting requirements to keep their license active.
