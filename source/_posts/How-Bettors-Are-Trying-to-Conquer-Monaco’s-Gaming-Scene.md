#  Banks Start Quitting Monaco’s Sports Betting Industry 

In what is seen as a reaction to new regulations in the country, several banks have announced that they will be quitting Monaco’s sports betting industry. The government of Monaco, which is a tiny principality on the Mediterranean coast, has been moving to regulate the industry in recent months.

Monaco’s gambling regulator, the Autorité de Contrôle des Jeux (ACJ), published new rules at the end of 2017 that require licensed operators to provide live streaming of sporting events and make data on bets available to the ACJ. The new rules also prohibit operators from offering odds on French or Italian football matches.

This prompted several banks, including Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, to announce that they would be withdrawing their services from Monaco’s sports betting industry. UBS has also said it is considering its options in light of the new regulations.

The move by the banks is likely to impact several licensed operators in Monaco, including Betclic, Goldenpalace and Circus Casino. All three companies were acquired by French gaming group Groupe Bernard Tapie last year.

#  Unfair Play in Monaco Gambling? 

The principality of Monaco is well-known for its gambling scene. The rich and famous come to play in the high-stakes casinos, which offer some of the best odds in the world. 

However, there are allegations that the casinos may not be playing fair. In particular, some players believe that the house has a hidden edge which gives it an unfair advantage. 

These accusations first surfaced in early 2017, when a group of players filed a complaint with the local authorities. They claimed that the casino was using algorithms to tilt the odds in their favour. 

The casino denies these allegations, insisting that it plays by the rules. However, many people remain suspicious, and there is no concrete evidence to support either side of the argument. 

So what is really going on in Monaco? Is the casino cheating its players or is it simply a case of sour grapes? Only time will tell…

#  Why it’s so Hard to Win at Sports Betting in Monaco 

There are a lot of reasons why it’s hard to win at sports betting in Monaco. One reason is that Monaco has some of the strictest gambling laws in the world. Another reason is that there are just so many sports to bet on, and it can be difficult to stay up-to-date on all of them. Additionally, the casinos in Monaco have a huge edge over the players, thanks to their extensive knowledge of sports and their ability to make well-informed bets.

Monaco’s gambling laws are among the most restrictive in the world. This means that there are very few places where you can actually place a sports bet. The few places that do offer sports betting typically have very poor odds, making it difficult to win any money. In addition, Monaco’s casinos are extremely well-informed about sports, and they often know what the outcome of a game is going to be before it even starts. This gives them a huge edge over players, who typically don’t have access to the same level of information.

There are dozens of different sports that you can bet on in Monaco. However, it can be difficult to stay up-to-date on all of them, especially if you’re not from Monaco. The casinos in Monaco have experts on staff who are always aware of what’s happening in the sporting world, and they use this information to make informed bets. As a result, players typically don’t stand a chance against the casinos when it comes to sports betting.

In spite of these challenges, there is still potential for success when betting on sports in Monaco. By doing your research and using informed strategy, you may be able to overcome some of the obstacles that stand in your way. Just remember that it will be a uphill battle, and you shouldn’t expect to beat the casinos every time

#  Expert Tips for Beating the Bookies in Monaco

## 1. Bet on underdogs

Despite their small size and limited resources, Monaco are a potent footballing force and always cause problems for their opponents. They tend to be tighter defensively at home, which is where the value lies when betting on them. Opposing teams often underestimate Monaco, which can lead to some good betting opportunities when backing the underdog.

## 2. Pick your spots with big bets

When it comes to betting on big games, it’s important to pick your spots wisely. Just because Monaco are a good bet doesn’t mean you should bet on them in every game. Look for opportunities where they are clear favourites and back them accordingly. This will maximise your profits without exposing you to too much risk.

## 3. Use hedging tactics

One of the best ways to beat the bookies in Monaco is by using hedging tactics. This involves placing multiple small bets on different outcomes and then hedging your bets if one of them starts to look like it might not succeed. This minimises your losses if things don’t go according to plan, while still giving you a chance of making a profit if everything falls into place.
