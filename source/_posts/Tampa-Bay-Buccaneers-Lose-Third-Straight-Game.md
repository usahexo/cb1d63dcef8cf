#  Tampa Bay Buccaneers Lose Third Straight Game

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost their third consecutive game on Sunday, this time to the New Orleans Saints by a score of 31-24. The Bucs are now 2-3 on the season and have some serious work to do in order to make a run at the playoffs.

Offensively, the Bucs struggled for most of the day. Jameis Winston completed just 21 of 38 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw two interceptions. The running game was nonexistent, as Doug Martin and Jacquizz Rodgers combined for just 47 yards on 18 carries. Mike Evans led the team in receiving with six catches for 70 yards and a touchdown, while Cameron Brate added four receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown.

The defense played well early on, but eventually wore down as the Saints piled up 463 total yards. Cameron Jordan led the way for New Orleans with three sacks, while Marshon Lattimore picked off Winston twice.

With the loss, the Buccaneers fall to second place in the NFC South behind the Atlanta Falcons. They will host the Buffalo Bills next week before traveling to Carolina to take on the Panthers in Week 7.

#  Bucs Fall to 3-3 After 27-21 Loss to Atlanta Falcons

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have now fallen to a 3-3 record after their 27-21 loss against the Atlanta Falcons. This was a game that the Bucs could have easily won, but unfortunately, they just couldn't pull it off in the end.

The Bucs got off to a great start, scoring an early touchdown and then holding the Falcons scoreless for most of the first half. However, the Falcons managed to score two touchdowns in the last few minutes of the second quarter, taking a 14-7 lead into halftime.

In the third quarter, Tampa Bay evened things up with another touchdown and then took the lead in the fourth quarter with a field goal. However, Atlanta was not done yet and they scored another touchdown late in the game to take back the lead. The Bucs tried to come back with a final drive, but they ultimately fell short and lost by six points.

This was definitely a disappointing loss for Tampa Bay, but there are still eight more games left in the season so they have plenty of time to make up for it. The Bucs will next be playing against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 28th.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost their third game in a row on Sunday, 27-21 to the Atlanta Falcons. The Bucs jumped out to an early 14-0 lead, but faltered down the stretch and lost for the third time in four games.

“Obviously we’re very disappointed with the result today,” Bucs head coach Dirk Koetter said after the game. “We had opportunities to make plays and we just didn’t make them when we needed to. We have to find a way to win these games.”

Jameis Winston threw for 215 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception late in the game that snuffed out any chance of a come-from-behind victory for Tampa Bay.

The Bucs are now 3-8 on the season and will face a tough test next week as they take on the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.
