#  Adrian Peterson Named NFL MVP!

In a unanimous vote by the Associated Press NFL panel, Adrian Peterson was named the MVP for the 2012-2013 NFL season.

This is the first time in Peterson's career that he has won the award. He led the league in rushing yards with 2,097 and also set a new single-season record with 12 touchdowns.

"It's a great honor," said Peterson after finding out about his award. "I want to thank all my teammates, coaches and everyone in the Vikings organization."

Peterson is also a strong contender for this year's MVP award, which will be announced in February. In addition to being dominant on the field, he has shown great character off of it by working hard to come back from a devastating knee injury last year.

#  Teddy Bridgewater Named Offensive Rookie of the Year!

Minnesota Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater has been named the offensive rookie of the year, according to NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport.

This is a well-deserved honor for Bridgewater, who had an impressive rookie season. He threw 14 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions while completing 64.4 percent of his passes. He also led the Vikings to a 7-9 record, which was a big improvement over their 5-10-1 record from the previous season.

Bridgewater's coach, Mike Zimmer, spoke highly of him after he was named the offensive rookie of the year. "Teddy did an amazing job this year," Zimmer said. "Not just on the field but in the locker room and in our meetings. He handled everything we asked him to do and more."

 Vikings fans are excited about Bridgewater's future and believe that he will lead them to victory in seasons to come.

#  What is a VPIP in Poker? Find out with the Minnesota Vikings!

The VPIP (Voluntarily Put Money In Pot) statistic measures what percentage of hands a poker player plays. In other words, it is the percentage of hands in which the player voluntarily puts money into the pot preflop.

VPIP is both a statistic and a measuring stick for poker players. It can be used to help identify leaks in players' games, as well as tendencies that may or may not be profitable.

For example, if you notice that your VPIP is significantly higher than the average player at your stakes, then you might have leaks in your game that you need to address. Conversely, if you have a low VPIP compared to the average player, then you're probably doing something right and should continue doing what you're doing!

In terms of measuring profitability, a high VPIP can sometimes be bad if it indicates that you are playing too many hands. On the other hand, a low VPIP can be good if it means that you are only playing the best hands and folding most of the time.

So how do you use VPIP to improve your game? The best way is to track your personal stats over time and see how they trend. Are they going up? Down? Stay roughly the same? This will give you a good idea of where your strengths and weaknesses lie.

Then, once you know where your leaks are, start addressing them one by one by tweaking your game accordingly. For example, if you're playing too many hands, then start folding more often. Or if you're not playing enough hands, then start calling more often preflop.

The bottom line is that VPIP can be a valuable tool for improving your poker game. So tracking your stats and using VPIP to make adjustments is definitely something worth doing!

#  Minnesota Vikings Season Recap: 11-5 Record, NFC North Champions

The Minnesota Vikings had an impressive season, finishing with an 11-5 record and winning the NFC North. They were led by their outstanding defense, which finished first in the league in points allowed. Here is a recap of the Vikings’ season.

The Vikings got off to a hot start, winning their first four games. However, they then lost three of their next four games, including back-to-back losses to the Los Angeles Rams and Philadelphia Eagles. However, they then reeled off seven straight wins to finish the season. The highlights of this streak included a win over the New Orleans Saints in Week 1 of the playoffs and a 29-24 victory over the New England Patriots in the NFC Championship Game.

However, their season ended with a disappointing 38-7 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl. The Vikings were unable to stop Nick Foles and the Eagles’ high-powered offense, and they will look to make improvements heading into next season.
