#  Nevada Gaming Commission to Discuss Esports Gambling Regulations

The Nevada Gaming Commission is scheduled to discuss the regulation of esports gambling on January 8.

“We are excited to explore the potential of this new and growing industry,” said commission chairman Tony Alamo, Jr.

Commissioners voted unanimously in December to form a subcommittee to study the issue and make recommendations. The subcommittee will include representatives from the casino industry, gaming regulators, and the esports community.

Esports betting is already taking place in Nevada, but there are no regulations in place to govern it.

“There’s been a lot of discussion about this topic but no action yet. That’s what we hope to change with this process,” said A.G. Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

Commissioners say they want to ensure that any regulations strike a balance between protecting consumers and allowing the industry to grow. They also want to make sure that Nevada remains competitive with other states that are also looking to regulate esports gambling.

# What is Esports?

Esports (electronic sports) is a form of competition using video games. Players compete against each other in multiplayer games, usually online, for prize money or scholarships. eSports tournaments have been held since the late 1990s, but they didn't become popular until the early 2010s when live streaming services such as Twitch allowed spectators to watch matches online.

As of 2018, there are over 2,000 professional eSports players from around the world who compete in tournaments for prize money totaling millions of dollars. The most popular eSports titles include Riot Games' League of Legends, Valve Corporation's Dota 2, and Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch and Hearthstone. In 2017, eSports generated over $696 million in revenue, up from $493 million in 2016.<br>

# Regulated Markets

#  Delaware Looks to Capitalize on Booming Esports Industry

The State of Delaware is looking to capitalize on the booming esports industry by creating a new division within its offices of economic development focused exclusively on the burgeoning market.

According to officials, the division will aim to attract new businesses and investment to the state while helping existing Delaware-based companies expand into the esports realm.

“We believe that esports represents a significant opportunity for Delaware businesses and look forward to working with our partners in the private sector to help achieve even more success in this industry,” said Governor John Carney.

The announcement follows a report from market research firm Newzoo which found that global spending on esports will reach $1.5 billion this year, up 26% from 2017. In comparison, global spending on traditional sports is estimated at $150 billion.

Much of the growth in esports is being driven by young people, with Newzoo estimating that more than half of all esport enthusiasts are aged 21 or younger. This presents an attractive opportunity for states and municipalities looking to attract new businesses and talent.

Delaware is not alone in its focus on esports. Last year, Las Vegas successfully lobbied to host The International, one of the world’s most prominent esports tournaments. The event brought in 18,000 fans and generated over $25 million in economic impact for the city.

Other states are also starting to take notice of the potential for growth in the industry. In Michigan, for example, lawmakers are currently discussing a bill that would create an official state gaming commission tasked with regulating and developing the esports industry.

#  Pennsylvania Approves Online Gambling for Esports Events

# Pennsylvania residents will soon be able to place bets on esports events, as the state approved a new bill that allows for online gambling.

# The new bill was introduced by Representative George Dunbar and passed by a vote of 109-72. It now awaits the signature of Governor Tom Wolf, who is expected to sign it into law.

# Under the new bill, online gambling will be limited to Pennsylvanians over the age of 21. Players will be allowed to place bets on both professional and amateur esports events, including those hosted in Pennsylvania.

# Esports betting is quickly becoming a popular form of gambling, with revenues estimated to reach $1.5 billion by 2020. In 2017, the global esports audience reached 428 million people, with 71% of viewers being male and 29% female.

# The popularity of esports is only expected to grow in the years ahead, making Pennsylvania one of the first states to offer legal betting on these events. The passage of this bill signals a major shift in how lawmakers view esports, and it is likely that other states will follow suit in the coming years.

#  MGM Resorts International Partners with Unikrn for Esports Betting

MGM Resorts International has announced a partnership with Unikrn, a global esports company, to offer betting on competitive video gaming. The move paves the way for MGM to become the first U.S. gaming company to offer legal betting on esports, and is expected to increase international interest in the activity.

Unikrn CEO Rahul Sood believes that the pairing will "[open] up new opportunities for fans and further legitimize esports as a true sport." Esports generate billions of dollars in revenue each year, and the market is expected to grow by 50% in 2019. With this in mind, MGM Resorts International is well-positioned for continued success in the coming years.

#  New Jersey Looking to Regulate Esports Gambling

 Esports gambling is on the rise, but many states are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.

New Jersey is one of those states. The state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement is currently looking into the matter, and they plan to release draft regulations later this year.

According to division director David Rebuck, there are a few things the state needs to consider before regulating esports gambling.

For starters, Rebuck says the state needs to determine whether esports gambling is considered a game of skill or chance. If it’s determined to be a game of chance, then casinos will need to apply for an esports gambling license.

Rebuck also says the state will need to decide how much money players can wager on each match. And finally, the state will need to establish age restrictions for those who want to gamble on esports matches.

It’s still unclear how all of this will play out, but it’s safe to say that New Jersey is taking esport gambling seriously. Other states are likely to follow suit in the coming years.
