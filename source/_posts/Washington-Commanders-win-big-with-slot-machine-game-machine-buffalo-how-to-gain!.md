The Washington Commanders were sitting pretty at 3-0 after the first three weeks of the XFL season. Fans began to flock to see their new hometown heroes and quickly realized that this team was for real. They had some impressive wins, but Week 4 was especially significant because their opponent was the undefeated Seattle Dragons.

What’s been working for them? There’s no one definitive answer, but several factors have come into play.

For one, the Commanders boast an extremely talented offense. QB Cardale Jones has been stellar so far, completing nearly 72 percent of his passes for 858 yards and 11 touchdowns. RB Jaquan Yulee is also off to a great start, averaging over five yards per carry and totaling 266 rushing yards on the season. The receivers have contributed as well, with WR Reggie Gray leading the way with 259 yards and four touchdowns on 18 receptions.

On defense, things haven’t been quite as impressive but they’ve still been able to hold opponents to an average of just over 20 points per game. One big reason for this is their stout run defense – they’ve only allowed 104 rushing yards per game which is good for third best in the league. This unit will need to continue playing well if they want to make a deep playoff run.
