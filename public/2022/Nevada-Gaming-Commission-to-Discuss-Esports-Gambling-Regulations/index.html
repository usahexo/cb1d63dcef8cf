<p>“We are excited to explore the potential of this new and growing industry,” said commission chairman Tony Alamo, Jr.</p>
<p>Commissioners voted unanimously in December to form a subcommittee to study the issue and make recommendations. The subcommittee will include representatives from the casino industry, gaming regulators, and the esports community.</p>
<p>Esports betting is already taking place in Nevada, but there are no regulations in place to govern it.</p>
<p>“There’s been a lot of discussion about this topic but no action yet. That’s what we hope to change with this process,” said A.G. Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Commissioners say they want to ensure that any regulations strike a balance between protecting consumers and allowing the industry to grow. They also want to make sure that Nevada remains competitive with other states that are also looking to regulate esports gambling.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Esports"><a href="#What-is-Esports" class="headerlink" title="What is Esports?"></a>What is Esports?</h1><p>Esports (electronic sports) is a form of competition using video games. Players compete against each other in multiplayer games, usually online, for prize money or scholarships. eSports tournaments have been held since the late 1990s, but they didn’t become popular until the early 2010s when live streaming services such as Twitch allowed spectators to watch matches online.</p>
<p>As of 2018, there are over 2,000 professional eSports players from around the world who compete in tournaments for prize money totaling millions of dollars. The most popular eSports titles include Riot Games’ League of Legends, Valve Corporation’s Dota 2, and Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch and Hearthstone. In 2017, eSports generated over $696 million in revenue, up from $493 million in 2016.<br></p>
<h1 id="History-of-Esports-Gambling"><a href="#History-of-Esports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="History of Esports Gambling"></a>History of Esports Gambling</h1><p>While traditional sports betting has been around for centuries, wagering on eSports is a relatively new phenomenon that has only gained significant traction in recent years.<br>The first known instance of someone placing a bet on an eSports match occurred back in 1999 when two Australian Counter-Strike fans wagered AU$100 on a match.<br>In 2015, UK-based betting company Pinnacle Sports became the first major online sportsbook to offer odds on eSports matches.<br>A year later, South Korea’s NHN Entertainment Corporation partnered with global online gambling company BtoBet to launch an international platform dedicated solely to eSports betting.<br>Since then, the market for eSports gambling has continued to grow at an exponential rate.<br></p>
<h1 id="Regulated-Markets"><a href="#Regulated-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Regulated Markets"></a>Regulated Markets</h1><p>As interest in eSports continues to surge, more and more countries are starting to regulate and legalize it as a form of gambling.<br>China was one of the first countries to do so back in 2014 when it legalized wagering on professional competitive video gaming matches.<br>In March 2017, Netherlands-based Unikrn announced that it had secured licensing from Malta’s Gaming Authority which allows it offer real-money betting on eSports matches across most European Union countries.<br>In October 2017, US state New Jersey passed legislation legalizing bets on both collegiate and professional eSports contests; however implementation has been delayed due to regulatory issues.<br>Australia followed suit a few months later in December 2017 when it amended its Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA)to include competitive video gaming matches under its definition of ‘gambling services’.<br>South Korea took things one step further by announcing plans earlier this year to build two dedicated venues for hosting competitive video gaming tournaments – each with a seating capacity of 10,000 people! &lt; br &gt;<br>Throughout 2018 we can expect many more countries – including Spain and Ireland – to start regulating eSports gambling within their own jurisdictions.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Looks-to-Capitalize-on-Booming-Esports-Industry"><a href="#Delaware-Looks-to-Capitalize-on-Booming-Esports-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Looks to Capitalize on Booming Esports Industry"></a>Delaware Looks to Capitalize on Booming Esports Industry</h1><p>The State of Delaware is looking to capitalize on the booming esports industry by creating a new division within its offices of economic development focused exclusively on the burgeoning market.</p>
<p>According to officials, the division will aim to attract new businesses and investment to the state while helping existing Delaware-based companies expand into the esports realm.</p>
<p>“We believe that esports represents a significant opportunity for Delaware businesses and look forward to working with our partners in the private sector to help achieve even more success in this industry,” said Governor John Carney.</p>
<p>The announcement follows a report from market research firm Newzoo which found that global spending on esports will reach $1.5 billion this year, up 26% from 2017. In comparison, global spending on traditional sports is estimated at $150 billion.</p>
<p>Much of the growth in esports is being driven by young people, with Newzoo estimating that more than half of all esport enthusiasts are aged 21 or younger. This presents an attractive opportunity for states and municipalities looking to attract new businesses and talent.</p>
<p>Delaware is not alone in its focus on esports. Last year, Las Vegas successfully lobbied to host The International, one of the world’s most prominent esports tournaments. The event brought in 18,000 fans and generated over $25 million in economic impact for the city.</p>
<p>Other states are also starting to take notice of the potential for growth in the industry. In Michigan, for example, lawmakers are currently discussing a bill that would create an official state gaming commission tasked with regulating and developing the esports industry.</p>

The move paves the way for MGM to become the first U.S. gaming company to offer legal betting on esports, and is expected to increase international interest in the activity.</p>
<p>Unikrn CEO Rahul Sood believes that the pairing will “[open] up new opportunities for fans and further legitimize esports as a true sport.” Esports generate billions of dollars in revenue each year, and the market is expected to grow by 50% in 2019. With this in mind, MGM Resorts International is well-positioned for continued success in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Looking-to-Regulate-Esports-Gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-Looking-to-Regulate-Esports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Looking to Regulate Esports Gambling"></a>New Jersey Looking to Regulate Esports Gambling</h1><p> Esports gambling is on the rise, but many states are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.</p>
<p>New Jersey is one of those states. The state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement is currently looking into the matter, and they plan to release draft regulations later this year.</p>
<p>According to division director David Rebuck, there are a few things the state needs to consider before regulating esports gambling.</p>
<p>For starters, Rebuck says the state needs to determine whether esports gambling is considered a game of skill or chance. If it’s determined to be a game of chance, then casinos will need to apply for an esports gambling license.</p>
<p>Rebuck also says the state will need to decide how much money players can wager on each match. And finally, the state will need to establish age restrictions for those who want to gamble on esports matches.</p>
<p>It’s still unclear how all of this will play out, but it’s safe to say that New Jersey is taking esport gambling seriously. Other states are likely to follow suit in the coming years.</p>
